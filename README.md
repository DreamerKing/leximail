Welcome to LexiMail! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kimus/leximail.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kimus/leximail)
-------------------

This is an early version of LexiMail, Open Source and cross-platform e-mail desktop application that's *built* in HTML, CSS and Node.JS.

Most of the initial layout was 'borrowed' from LightRead but the plan is to be themable in the future.
No much more to see for now.

Here is a sample screenshot:
